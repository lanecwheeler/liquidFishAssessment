# liquidfish Full Stack Developer Test

## SETUP
1. Clone this repo to your machine.  
2. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and push the cloned project to your new repo. **Do not fork this project.**
3. Once completed with the assessment, please email us a link to your git repo.  

## TASK BREAKDOWN
1. Create a Laravel website that has a frontend responsive form based on the jpg designs provided in the repo. The two columns on the form should stack and be 100% width on smaller screens.
2. Validate the form on the frontend and backend  
3. Submit the form via AJAX to a controller  
4. Store that submission into a database that you will create via Laravel migrations (we will run these to get your database set up on our end)  
5. Email the form to the user. 
6. Upon success, show the designed success message.  

*Bonus Points: Add any UX ‚Äúflare" or animations that you think would be beneficial. ;)*  

*Please provide database migrations to create the database and any environment variables we will need to run your application.*    

*We will provide the SMTP credentials.*

## Here goes nothing...
Changing the readme so I can have the right commit message

## There went everything...
Changing the readme again so I can commit this at the 4 hour mark

### TODO:
1. Success message on happy submission :)
2. Error fields on sad submissions :(
3. A knock your socks off svg animation
4. General css flair (love me some good hovers and such)

Looking back, I wish I had started with Laravel's Vue bootstrapper, it just totally slipped my mind! 

## Here goes nothing pt. 2: The Reckoning...
Starting back up this Sunday so I can finish the front end. Also, Happy Easter! üê∞üê•ü•ö
